Pages go into `pages/`.

The folder and file structure in `pages/` will be used for the table of content.

Generate and render the pages using `./tools/render`.

## Credits

- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) for some of the code
  snippets.
- [KACTL](https://github.com/kth-competitive-programming/kactl) for the
  idea. We try not to add code that's already in KACTL, because we also use
  KACTL.
