## Contribution

Pages go into `pages/`. Pages that implement code should either be `.hpp` or
`.cpp`, otherwise they should be `.md`.

The folder and file structure in `pages/` will be used for the table of content.

Generate and render the pages using `./tools/build`.

## Credits

- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) for some of the code
  snippets.
- [KACTL](https://github.com/kth-competitive-programming/kactl) for the
  idea. We try not to add code that's already in KACTL, because we also use
  KACTL.
- and many more, see each page for the credits.
